## Features

![Logo](https://github.com/insanoid/SwiftyJSONAccelerator/blob/master/preview.png)

A Swift model generator like the Objective-C [JSONAccelerator](http://nerdery.com/json-accelerator). Formats and generates models for the given JSON and also breaks them into files making it easy to manage and share between several models.

- The models that are generated depend Swift's inbuilt `Codeable` feature making encoding and decoding objects a thing of the past.
- Allows to opt for either optional or non-optional variables.
- Allows an array of a certain object type with different properties to be merged into a single model with all properties.
- Click `Load folder with JSON files + Config` to generate all possible models for given folder with JSON files, note this needs a `.config.json` as this uses the CLI logic internally.

## TODO

- CLI tool needs to be recreated
- Tests needed to be added again
- Sparkle integration to deploy newer versions
- Deployment using homebrew
- Add support for [Codextended](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Codextended).
